# Special objects

Some objects of this protocol are special, and don't belong in the hierarchy of a global.

You know already two of them: `wl_display` and `wl_registry`.

## The Display

The `wl_display` represents the connexion from a client to the compositor. It is automatically
created upon the creation of the connexion, and can be used by the client to create the `wl_registry`
and manage the dispatching of events.

It also receives any protocol error generated by the client, allowing a diagnostic of what happenned
(but not recovery from it).

## The Registry

The `wl_registry` is the gate to all other globals. Upon creation, it receives as events the list of
all existing globals, as well as notification during the whole life of the client whenever a new
global is created or destroyed.

The client can instanciate the registry several times. In this case, each instance will be notified
of all globals.

## The Callback

The `wl_callback` object is created whevener a request asks the compositor to do something and
requires to be notified when it is done. The callback object has no request and a single event:
`wl_callback::done`, which is called exactly once, when the task is finished.

For example, the request `wl_display::sync` requires the composior to fire the callback just when it
processed the request. Has it must process the requests in the same order as it receives them, this
guarantees that all pending requests sent before this sync have been processed.
