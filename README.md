# In development

The master branch of this repo is a new rewrite of the lib, in development, that will complemetely break the API.

The version currently on crates.io is located on the `v0.6.x` branch, and its documentation can be found [on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/wayland-client/0.6.2/wayland_client/).

# Wayland client

These are bindings to the [reference implementation](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/)
of the wayland protocol. This is not a pure rust implementation of the wayland
protocol, and thus requires `libwayland-client.so` to be available.

## Documentation

The documentation is [available online](http://vberger.github.io/wayland-client-rs/wayland_client/).
